# Semiconductors

## What is a semiconductor?

<!-- <h4>Semiconductors</h4> -->

A <strong>semiconductor</strong> is a material with conductivity between that of a conductor and that of an insulator.

The conductivity of semiconductors can be manipulated (or controlled) by changing temperature, applying light or voltage, or adding impurities (a process called <strong>doping</strong>).

    <h4>Key properties</h4>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>1. Intermediate conductivity:</strong> Unlike conductors (like copper) or insulators (like glass), semiconductors have a conductivity that can be controlled.</li>
     <li><strong>2. Controllable conductivity:</strong> Their electrical properties can be adjusted through external factors, making them perfect for controlling the flow of electricity.</li>
     <li><strong>3. Doping:</strong> By adding tiny amounts of other elements, a process called doping, the semiconductor's electrical behavior can be precisely engineered.</li>
</ul>
