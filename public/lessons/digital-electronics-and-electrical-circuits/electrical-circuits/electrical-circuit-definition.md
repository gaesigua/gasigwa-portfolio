# Electrical Circuit

An <strong>electric circuit</strong> (also known as electrical circuit or electric network) is an interconnection of electrical elements linked together in a closed path so that an electric current may flow continuously. In other words, it is basically a loop that allows electric current to flow.

It consists of a power source, conductors (wires), and usually some components that use the electrical energy.

    <h4>ðŸ”‘ Essential Components of a Circuit</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Power Source:</strong> Provides electrical energy (battery, generator, power supply)</li>
            <li><strong>2. Conductors:</strong> Wires that carry current between components</li>
            <li><strong>3. Load:</strong> Devices that use electrical energy (light bulb, motor, resistor)</li>
            <li><strong>4. Control Device:</strong> Switches, buttons that control current flow</li>
            <li><strong>5. Protection:</strong> Fuses, circuit breakers that prevent damage</li>
        </ul>
