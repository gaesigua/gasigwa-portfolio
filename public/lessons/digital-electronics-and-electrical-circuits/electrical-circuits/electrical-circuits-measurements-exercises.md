# Practical Measurement Exercises

**Example 1:** **Measuring Current**

<div class="example">
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to measure the current flowing through a light bulb in a circuit.</p>
                     
<div class="calculation">
<strong>Steps:</strong>
1. Turn off the power supply
2. Break the circuit - disconnect one wire from the bulb
3. Connect ammeter in series:
   - One lead to the disconnected point
   - Other lead to the bulb terminal
4. Ensure correct polarity (current flows from + to -)
5. Set ammeter to appropriate range (e.g., 10 A range)
6. Turn on power supply
7. Read the current value
8. If reading is low, switch to lower range for better accuracy

<strong>Example Reading:</strong>
If ammeter shows 0.5 A on the 10 A range
You could switch to 1 A range for more precise reading

<strong>Result:</strong> Current through bulb = 0.5 A

**Example 2:** **Measuring Voltage**

<div class="example">
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to measure the voltage across a resistor in a circuit.</p>
                        
<div class="calculation">
<strong>Steps:</strong>
1. Keep the circuit connected and powered
2. Identify the two points across the resistor
3. Connect voltmeter in parallel:
   - Connect + lead to the point closer to battery +
   - Connect - lead to the point closer to battery -
4. Set voltmeter to appropriate range (e.g., 20 V)
5. Read the voltage
6. Adjust range if necessary for accuracy

<strong>Example Reading:</strong>
Circuit has 12 V battery, resistor shows 8 V drop

<strong>Result:</strong> Voltage across resistor = 8 V
<strong>Note:</strong> Remaining 4 V is dropped across other 
components or internal resistance
                        </div>
                    </div>

**Example 3:** **Measuring Resistance**

<div class="example">
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to verify the resistance of a resistor marked as 100 Œ©.</p>
                        
<div class="calculation">
<strong>Steps:</strong>
1. Completely disconnect resistor from any circuit
2. Ensure no power is connected
3. If resistor was in a circuit with capacitors, 
   wait for capacitors to discharge
4. Set multimeter/ohmmeter to resistance mode
5. Select appropriate range (e.g., 200 Œ© range)
6. Connect leads to both ends of resistor
7. Read the resistance value

<strong>Example Reading:</strong>
Meter shows 98.5 Œ©

<strong>Analysis:</strong>
Marked value: 100 Œ©
Measured value: 98.5 Œ©
Tolerance: Most resistors have ¬±5% or ¬±10% tolerance
100 Œ© ¬± 5% = 95 to 105 Œ© ‚úì

<strong>Result:</strong> Resistor is within tolerance, functioning correctly

<h3>Safety Guidelines for Measurements</h3>
                    <div class="warning">
                        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">‚ö†Ô∏è Safety First!</h5>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                            <li><strong>Never touch bare wires</strong> or exposed connections when power is on</li>
                            <li><strong>Always start with highest range</strong> when unsure of expected values</li>
                            <li><strong>Check meter settings</strong> before connecting to circuit</li>
                            <li><strong>Use proper leads</strong> - check for damage before use</li>
                            <li><strong>Discharge capacitors</strong> before measuring resistance</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't measure resistance</strong> in powered circuits</li>
                            <li><strong>Observe polarity</strong> for DC measurements</li>
                            <li><strong>Keep one hand in pocket</strong> when measuring high voltages</li>
                            <li><strong>Use insulated tools</strong> and work on insulated surfaces</li>
                            <li><strong>Know your instrument limits</strong> - don't exceed maximum ratings</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Avoid These Mistakes:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Wrong Connection:</strong> Ammeter in parallel or voltmeter in series</li>

                            <li><strong>Reversed Polarity:</strong> Can damage analog meters or give negative readings</li>
                            <li><strong>Loading Effect:</strong> Meter changes circuit behavior (especially with high-resistance circuits)</li>
                            <li><strong>Parallax Error:</strong> Reading analog meters from wrong angle</li>
                            <li><strong>Zero Error:</strong> Not zeroing the meter before measurement</li>
                            <li><strong>Contact Resistance:</strong> Poor connections giving false readings</li>
