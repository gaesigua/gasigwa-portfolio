# Practical Measurement Exercises

**Example 1:** **Measuring Current**

<div class="example">
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to measure the current flowing through a light bulb in a circuit.</p>
                     
<div class="calculation">
<strong>Steps:</strong><br>
1. Turn off the power supply<br>
2. Break the circuit - disconnect one wire from the bulb<br>
3. Connect ammeter in series:<br>
   - One lead to the disconnected point<br>
   - Other lead to the bulb terminal<br>
4. Ensure correct polarity (current flows from + to -)<br>
5. Set ammeter to appropriate range (e.g., 10 A range)<br>
6. Turn on power supply<br>
7. Read the current value<br>
8. If reading is low, switch to lower range for better accuracy<br>

<strong>Example Reading:</strong><br>
If ammeter shows 0.5 A on the 10 A range
You could switch to 1 A range for more precise reading

<strong>Result:</strong> Current through bulb = 0.5 A

                    </div>

**Example 2:** **Measuring Voltage**

<div class="example">
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to measure the voltage across a resistor in a circuit.</p>
                        
<div class="calculation">
<strong>Steps:</strong><br>
1. Keep the circuit connected and powered<br>
2. Identify the two points across the resistor<br>
3. Connect voltmeter in parallel:<br>
   - Connect + lead to the point closer to battery +<br>
   - Connect - lead to the point closer to battery -<br>
4. Set voltmeter to appropriate range (e.g., 20 V)<br>
5. Read the voltage<br>
6. Adjust range if necessary for accuracy<br>

<strong>Example Reading:</strong><br>
Circuit has 12 V battery, resistor shows 8 V drop

<strong>Result:</strong> Voltage across resistor = 8 V<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Remaining 4 V is dropped across other 
components or internal resistance
                        </div>
                    </div>

**Example 3:** **Measuring Resistance**

<div class="example">
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to verify the resistance of a resistor marked as 100 Ω.</p>
                        
<div class="calculation">
<strong>Steps:</strong><br>
1. Completely disconnect resistor from any circuit<br>
2. Ensure no power is connected<br>
3. If resistor was in a circuit with capacitors, 
   wait for capacitors to discharge<br>
4. Set multimeter/ohmmeter to resistance mode<br>
5. Select appropriate range (e.g., 200 Ω range)<br>
6. Connect leads to both ends of resistor<br>
7. Read the resistance value<br>

<strong>Example Reading:</strong><br>
Meter shows 98.5 Ω

<strong>Analysis:</strong>
Marked value: 100 Ω
Measured value: 98.5 Ω
Tolerance: Most resistors have ±5% or ±10% tolerance
100 Ω ± 5% = 95 to 105 Ω ✓

<strong>Result:</strong> Resistor is within tolerance, functioning correctly
