                        <h4>Example 1: Effect of Doubling Cross-Sectional Area</h4>
                        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A wire has conductance of 5 S. What will be its conductance if the cross-sectional area is doubled while keeping length and material the same?</p>
                        
<div class="calculation">
<strong>Given:</strong>
G‚ÇÅ = 5 S
A‚ÇÇ = 2A‚ÇÅ

<strong>Analysis:</strong>
Since G = œÉA/L and œÉ and L are constant
G ‚àù A

<strong>Solution:</strong>
G‚ÇÇ/G‚ÇÅ = A‚ÇÇ/A‚ÇÅ
G‚ÇÇ/5 = 2A‚ÇÅ/A‚ÇÅ
G‚ÇÇ = 5 √ó 2
G‚ÇÇ = 10 S

<strong>Answer: The new conductance is 10 S (doubled)</strong>

                        <h4>Example 2: Effect of Length Change</h4>
                        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A conductor of length 2 m has conductance 8 S. If the length is increased to 5 m (keeping area constant), what is the new conductance?</p>
                        
<div class="calculation">
<strong>Given:</strong>
G‚ÇÅ = 8 S, L‚ÇÅ = 2 m
L‚ÇÇ = 5 m

<strong>Analysis:</strong>
Since G = œÉA/L and œÉ and A are constant
G ‚àù 1/L

<strong>Solution:</strong>
G‚ÇÅL‚ÇÅ = G‚ÇÇL‚ÇÇ
8 √ó 2 = G‚ÇÇ √ó 5
16 = G‚ÇÇ √ó 5
G‚ÇÇ = 16/5
G‚ÇÇ = 3.2 S

<strong>Answer: The new conductance is 3.2 S</strong>

<strong>Check:</strong> Length increased by factor of 5/2 = 2.5
So conductance should decrease by factor of 2.5
8 / 2.5 = 3.2 S ‚úì

                        <h4>Example 3: Material Comparison</h4>
                        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Two wires have identical dimensions. Wire A is copper (œÉ = 5.96 √ó 10‚Å∑ S/m) and Wire B is aluminum (œÉ = 3.5 √ó 10‚Å∑ S/m). If the copper wire has conductance of 10 S, what is the conductance of the aluminum wire?</p>
                        
<div class="calculation">
<strong>Given:</strong>
G_copper = 10 S
œÉ_copper = 5.96 √ó 10‚Å∑ S/m
œÉ_aluminum = 3.5 √ó 10‚Å∑ S/m
Same dimensions (A and L)

<strong>Analysis:</strong>
Since A and L are the same
G ‚àù œÉ

<strong>Solution:</strong>
G_aluminum/G_copper = œÉ_aluminum/œÉ_copper
G_aluminum/10 = (3.5 √ó 10‚Å∑)/(5.96 √ó 10‚Å∑)
G_aluminum = 10 √ó (3.5/5.96)
G_aluminum = 10 √ó 0.587
G_aluminum = 5.87 S

<strong>Answer: The aluminum wire has conductance of 5.87 S</strong>

<strong>Interpretation:</strong> Aluminum has about 59% the conductance 
of copper for the same dimensions.

                        <strong>üí° Key Takeaway:</strong> To maximize conductance in a conductor: use materials with high conductivity (like copper or silver), increase cross-sectional area, minimize length, keep temperature low, and use pure materials without defects.
