# Electric Circuit

## What is an electric circuit?

An <strong>electric circuit</strong> (also known as electrical circuit) is a closed path or loop through which electric current can flow. 

It consists of a power source, conductors (wires), and usually some components that use the electrical energy.

    <h4>🔑 Essential Components of a Circuit:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Power Source:</strong> Provides electrical energy (battery, generator, power supply)</li>
        <li><strong>2. Conductors:</strong> Wires that carry current between components</li>
        <li><strong>3. Load:</strong> Devices that use electrical energy (light bulb, motor, resistor)</li>
        <li><strong>4. Control Device:</strong> Switches, buttons that control current flow</li>
        <li><strong>5. Protection:</strong> Fuses, circuit breakers that prevent damage</li>
    </ul>

## Simple Circuit Diagram
                    
<div class="circuit-diagram">
    <div style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 2;">
                            <p>┌─────────[Switch]─────────┐</p>
                            <p>│                           │</p>
                            <p>[Battery +−]            [Bulb 💡]</p>
                            <p>│                           │</p>
                            <p>└───────────────────────────┘</p>
                        </div>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px; color: #666;">When the switch is closed, current flows from the battery through the bulb, making it light up.</p>

            <h5>Open Circuit</h5>
            <p>Incomplete path - current cannot flow. Switch is open or wire is broken.</p>

            <div class="icon">🟢</div>
            <h5>Closed Circuit</h5>
            <p>Complete path - current flows continuously. Switch is closed.</p>

            <div class="icon">⚠️</div>
            <h5>Short Circuit</h5>
            <p>Path of very low resistance, bypassing the load. Can cause damage.</p>

<div class="warning">
                        <strong>⚠️ Safety Warning:</strong> Short circuits can cause excessive current flow, leading to overheating, fire, or damage to components. Always use proper fuses and circuit breakers for protection.
