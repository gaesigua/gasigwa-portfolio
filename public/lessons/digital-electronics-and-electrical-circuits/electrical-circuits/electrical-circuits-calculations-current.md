# üîã Electric Current - Formula

<!-- <div class="definition-card">
  <h4>Definition of Electric Current</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Electric current</strong> is the rate of flow of electric charge through a conductor. It represents how much charge passes through a cross-section of a conductor per unit time.

  <h4>Formula for Electric Current</h4>
  <div class="formula">I = Q / t</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 1.1em">
    <p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
    <p>I = Current (Amperes, A)</p>
    <p>Q = Charge (Coulombs, C)</p>
    <p>t = Time (seconds, s)</p>

  <h4>Key Characteristics of Electric Current:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> I (for Intensity)</li>
      <li><strong>Unit:</strong> Ampere (A), named after Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re</li>
      <li><strong>Measuring Instrument:</strong> Ammeter (connected in series)</li>
      <li><strong>Conventional Current Direction:</strong> From positive to negative terminal</li>
      <li><strong>Electron Flow Direction:</strong> From negative to positive terminal (opposite to conventional)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="note">
  <strong>üí° Historical Note:</strong> Conventional current direction was
      established before the discovery of electrons. Scientists assumed positive
      charges moved, but we now know electrons (negative) actually move. We
      still use conventional direction for consistency.

## Understanding Current Flow

<div class="definition-card">
  <h4>What Actually Moves?</h4>
  <p>In metallic conductors, electric current is due to the flow of <strong>free electrons</strong> (negatively charged particles). These electrons drift from the negative terminal through the conductor to the positive terminal.</p>
