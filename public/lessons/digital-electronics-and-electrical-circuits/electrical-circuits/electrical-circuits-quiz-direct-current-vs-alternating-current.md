When the answer is correct, the background color should turn into dark green or dark blue; and then "Next" button

Question 1: Which type of current flows in one direction only?

A. Alternating Current (AC)
Incorrect. This is not the primary disadvantage of DC for long-distance transmission.

B. Direct Current (DC)
Correct! Direct Current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge.

C. Pulsating Current
Incorrect. While pulsating DC flows in one direction, its magnitude changes. The fundamental characteristic of DC is its unidirectional flow.

D. Variable Current
Incorrect. "Variable current" is a general term and doesn't specify the direction of flow.

Show hint:
Think about what the "D" in DC stands for.



Question 2: Which of the following is a primary source of Direct Current (DC)?

A. Wall outlet
Incorrect. Wall outlets typically provide Alternating Current (AC).

B. Generator at a power plant
Incorrect. Power plant generators produce Alternating Current (AC) for efficient long-distance transmission.

C. Battery
Correct! Batteries store chemical energy and release it as Direct Current (DC).

D. Transformer
Incorrect. Transformers are used to change the voltage of Alternating Current (AC) and do not produce DC.

Show hint:
Consider what powers your portable electronic devices.


Question 3: Alternating Current (AC) is used for long-distance power transmission because its voltage can be easily stepped up or down.

A. True
Correct! Transformers can efficiently change the voltage of AC, which is crucial for minimizing power loss over long distances.

B. False
Incorrect. The ability to easily change its voltage is a key advantage of AC for power transmission.

Show hint:
Think about how electricity gets from a power plant to your home.



Question 4: What is the standard frequency of Alternating Current (AC) in Rwanda?

A. 50 Hz
Incorrect. 50 Hz is the standard frequency in Europe and many other parts of the world.

B. 100 Hz
Incorrect. This frequency is not a standard for power distribution.

C. 60 Hz
Correct! The standard frequency for AC power in Rwanda is 60 Hz.

D. 120 Hz
Incorrect. While the current changes direction 120 times per second at 60 Hz, the frequency itself is 60 Hz.


Show hint:
Different regions of the world have different standard frequencies for their power grids.


Question 5: What device is used to convert Alternating Current (AC) to Direct Current (DC)?

A. Inverter
Incorrect. An inverter converts DC to AC.

B. Transformer
Incorrect. A transformer changes the voltage of AC but does not convert it to DC.

C. Rectifier
Correct! A rectifier is an electrical device that converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows in only one direction.

D. Capacitor
Incorrect. A capacitor stores electrical energy but does not convert AC to DC.


Show hint: Think about the component inside a phone charger that allows it to charge the battery.


Question 6: Most household appliances, like refrigerators and washing machines, run directly on Direct Current (DC).

A. True
Incorrect. While many electronic devices use DC internally, most large household appliances plug into AC wall outlets and are designed to run on AC.

B. False
Correct! Most large household appliances are designed to run on the Alternating Current (AC) supplied by wall outlets.


Show hint: Consider the type of electricity that comes from a standard wall socket.


Question 7: The flow of electrons in Alternating Current (AC) is best described as:

A. A continuous flow in one direction
show: Incorrect. This describes Direct Current (DC).

B. A back-and-forth motion
Correct! In AC, the electrons periodically reverse their direction of flow.

C. A random movement with no net flow
Incorrect. While individual electron movement can be random, there is a net flow of charge in a current.

D. A flow that gradually decreases over time
Incorrect. This describes a decaying current, not the fundamental nature of AC.

Show hint: Think about what the word "alternating" implies.

Question 8: Which of these historical figures was a major proponent of Direct Current (DC) for power distribution?

A. Nikola Tesla
show: Incorrect. Nikola Tesla was a major advocate for Alternating Current (AC).

B. Thomas Edison
Correct! Thomas Edison was a strong proponent of using Direct Current (DC) for widespread power distribution.

C. Alexander Graham Bell
Incorrect. Alexander Graham Bell is best known for his invention of the telephone.

D. Michael Faraday
Incorrect. Michael Faraday's work was foundational to the principles of electromagnetism, but he was not a central figure in the "war of currents."


Show hint: This was a key point of contention in the "war of currents" in the late 19th century.

Question 9: Solar panels generate Alternating Current (AC) directly.

A. True
Incorrect. Solar panels generate Direct Current (DC), which is then often converted to AC for use in homes.

B. False
Correct! Solar panels produce Direct Current (DC) through the photovoltaic effect. An inverter is needed to convert this to AC for household use.


Show hint: Think about how solar energy is stored and used in a home.

Question 10: What is a key disadvantage of using Direct Current (DC) for long-distance power transmission?

A. It is more dangerous than AC.
Incorrect. While both can be dangerous, this is not the primary reason DC is not used for long-distance transmission.

B. It cannot be easily converted to different voltages.
Correct! It is much more difficult and less efficient to change the voltage of DC compared to AC, making it less suitable for long-distance transmission where high voltages are needed to reduce power loss.

C. It causes more interference with communication signals.
Incorrect. This is not the primary disadvantage of DC for long-distance transmission.

D. It requires thicker wires than AC.
Incorrect. The opposite can be true in some high-voltage applications.

Show hint: Consider the role of transformers in the power grid.
