# Types of Electric Current

There are **2 types** of **current**:

**DC (Direct Current):** This is when the current flowing through an element is **constant** and **unidirectional** (meaning it does not change direction). Most modern electronic devices, such as smartphones and computers, use DC internally. Batteries can produce and store DC power to be used by other devices; for example, electric vehicle batteries. 
Solar panels generate DC electricity


**AC (Alternating Current):** This is when current flowing through an element is **not constant**, and **the flow can change direction** periodically, meaning the voltage also varies, and this creates a wave-like pattern. AC can easily have its voltage increased or decreased; this is an example of how electricity is transmitted from power plants to our homes, or the electricity from our homes' wall sockets that we use to power everyday devices like refrigerators, televisions, washing machines, etc.
