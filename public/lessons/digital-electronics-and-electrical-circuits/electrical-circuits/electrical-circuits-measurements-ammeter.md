## Basic Measuring Instruments
                    
<div class="definition-card">
    <h4>1. Ammeter</h4>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Measures electric current flowing through a circuit</p>
                        
<div class="key-points" style="margin-top: 15px;">
    <h4>Key Characteristics:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Unit:</strong> Amperes (A)</li>
                                <li><strong>Connection:</strong> Must be connected in SERIES with the circuit</li>
                                <li><strong>Internal Resistance:</strong> Very low (ideally zero) to avoid affecting circuit current</li>
                                <li><strong>Symbol in Circuit:</strong> A in a circle</li>
                                <li><strong>Polarity:</strong> Must be connected correctly (+ to + terminal)</li>
                            </ul>
</div>
                        
<div class="warning" style="margin-top: 15px;">
                            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:</strong> NEVER connect an ammeter in parallel with a power source! This creates a short circuit and can destroy the ammeter and cause danger.

                            <h4>How to Use an Ammeter:</h4>
                            <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li>Break the circuit at the point where current is to be measured</li>
                                <li>Connect the ammeter in series (current must flow through it)</li>
                                <li>Ensure correct polarity (current enters at + terminal)</li>
                                <li>Start with the highest range, then switch to lower ranges for accuracy</li>
                                <li>Read the measurement</li>
                            </ol>
