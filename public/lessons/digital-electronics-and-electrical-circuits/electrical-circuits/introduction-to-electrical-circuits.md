# Introduction

Electrical circuits are parts of the basic fabric of modern technology. 

As a computer scientist, understanding electrical circuits is a critical skill: to be able to analyse and design electric circuits used as the building blocks for modern technologies, from the simplest flashlight to complex computers, control systems, electronic and communication products, and many other consumer products.
