## What is Digital Electronics?


<p>People generally associate <strong>digital</strong> with any new trending, modern, electronic technology, that processes, stores, and communicates information.</p>
<p>For example, a laptop is a digital device that processes our photos, messages/emails, and allows us to communicate with our colleagues, family and friends; or the smart TVs in our homes, that displays news, music, games, etc.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>analog</strong> is the opposite of that. We often perceive <strong>analog</strong> as a more traditional or old-fashioned technology such as the old dactylography machines which were used to type content on papers back in the day.</p>

<p>However, technical-wise, <strong>digital</strong> is more than just that.</p> 
<p><strong>Digital</strong> can be referred to as a system that processes information in a numerical format, using a binary language of <strong>ones</strong> and <strong>zeros</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Digital electronics</strong> then will be defined as the field of electronics that deals with electronic circuits that operate using <strong>discrete</strong>, typically <strong>two levels</strong>, which represent the logical states of <strong>ON</strong> (or <strong>High</strong> or <strong>1</strong>) and <strong>OFF</strong> (or <strong>Low</strong> or <strong>0</strong>).

In simple terms, digital electronics is the backbone of all modern computing and communication. If a device works by counting, storing, or processing information as a sequence of ones and zeros (bits), it is using digital electronics.
