## What is Digital Electronics?

---

People generally associate **digital** with any new trending, modern, electronic technology, that processes, stores, and communicates information. Like for example, a laptop is a digital device that processes our photos, messages/emails, and allows us to communicate with our colleagues, family and friends; or the smart TVs in our homes, that displays news, music, games, etc.

Meanwhile, **analog** is the opposite of that; we often perceive **analog** as a more traditional or old-fashioned technology such as the old dactylography machines which were used to type content on papers back in the day.

However, technical-wise, **digital** is more than just that. **Digital** can be referred to as a system that processes information in a numerical format, using a binary language of **ones** and **zeros**.

**Digital electronics** then will be defined as the field of electronics that deals with electronic circuits that operate using discrete, typically **two levels**, which represent the logical states of **ON** (or **High** or **1**) and **OFF** (or **Low** or **0**).

In simple terms, digital electronics is the backbone of all modern computing and communication. If a device works by counting, storing, or processing information as a sequence of ones and zeros (bits), it is using digital electronics.
