## Analog vs. Digital Systems

---

To understand digital systems, it's helpful to compare them to their counterpart: **analog systems**.

|**Feature**|**Analog System**|**Digital System**|
|:----|:------|:---- |
|**Signal Type**| Continuous wave that varies smoothly over time. | Discrete signal that has a finite number of steps (usually two). |
|**Example**| Human voice, natural sounds, temperature, light intensity, a dimmer switch. | Computer data, smartphone microphone/speaker output, a light switch (on/off). |
|**Data Representation**| Uses a continuous range of voltage or current. Data to be transferred can be represented by Sine waves as the value of data is continuous. | Uses discrete values (typically 0 and 1). Data to be transferred can be represented by Square waves as it is discrete with time. |
|**Data Complexity**| Analog signals can transfer more complex types of data. | Digital signals are able to carry less complex data. |
|**Noise Immunity**| Lower. Noise (unwanted interference) easily corrupts the exact signal value. It is limited by noise and interference. | Higher. A signal must change significantly (e.g., from 0 to 1) to be corrupted. Less susceptible to/affected by noise. |
|**Storage**| Difficult to store and reproduce without degradation; Requires more storage. | Easy to store and reproduce exactly (perfect copies); Requires less storage/bandwidth. |
|**Degradation**| Prone to degrade over distance. | Less degradation over distance. |
|**Applications**| Analog signals are used in traditional microphones, smoke detectors, landline phones, thermometers, etc | Digital signals are used in computers, mobile phones, keyboards, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, digital audio and video devices, etc |
|**Power Usage**| Uses more power for data transmission. | Uses less power for conveying same amount of information. |
