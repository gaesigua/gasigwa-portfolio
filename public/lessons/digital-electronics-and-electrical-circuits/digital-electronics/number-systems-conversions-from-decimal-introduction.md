# ðŸ”„Converting FROM DECIMAL

In the next lesson, we will learn how to convert numbers from **Decimal** to other number systems (**Binary**, **Octal**, **Hexadecimal**).

Understanding these conversions is essential for computer science, programming, and digital electronics.

But first, let's recall what we have learned previously. The four main number systems are:

**- Binary (Base 2)**: Uses digits 0 and 1

**- Octal (Base 8)**: Uses digits 0-7

**- Decimal (Base 10)**: Uses digits 0-9

**- Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: Uses digits 0-9 and A-F
