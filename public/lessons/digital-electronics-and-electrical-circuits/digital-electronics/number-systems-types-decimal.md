# Types of Number Systems: Decimal

## 1. Decimal System (Base-10)

As we have seen previously, numbers are represented using a system defined by its **base** (or **radix**), which indicates the number of unique digits it uses. 

The **decimal** number system, also known as **base-10**, is the one most people are familiar with and use for everyday tasks like counting, tracking scores, or voting.

In this system, we use **ten** unique **_Digits_**: **0**,**1**,**2**,**3**,**4**,**5**,**6**,**7**,**8**,**9**.

**- Example:** The number **1234.567<sub>10</sub>**

In the illustration above, we have a number **1234.567** in the Decimal system.

The value of each digit depends on its position in the number.

**- Explanation:** 

Starting from the left, 

<div class="steps">

- **1** is in the thousands place (1 × 10³ = 1000),
- **2** is in the hundreds place (2 × 10² = 200), 
- **3** is in the tens place (3 × 10¹ = 30),
- **4** is in the ones place (4 × 10⁰ = 4). 

</div>

The decimal point is used to separate the whole number from the fractional part of a number.

After the decimal point, 

<div class="steps">

- **5** is in the tenths place (5 × 10⁻¹ = 0.5),
- **6** is in the hundredths place (6 × 10⁻² = 0.06),
- **7** is in the thousandths place (7 × 10⁻³ = 0.007).

</div>

Adding these together (1000 + 200 + 30 + 4 + 0.5 + 0.06 + 0.007) gives the total value, 1234.567
