# Types of Number Systems: Octal

## 3. Octal System (Base-8)

The word **Octal** comes from the Latin word **octo,** meaning **eight**. The **Octal** number system is a **base-8** system. Octal provides a convenient shorthand (way of writing) for binary because each octal digit corresponds to exactly **three** binary bits (since 2<sup>3</sup>=8). This makes it easier for humans to read, write, and understand long strings of binary information.

In this system, we use **8** unique **_Digits_**: **0**,**1**,**2**,**3**,**4**,**5**,**6**,**7**.

<div class="steps">

**Use Case:** This is a convenient shorthand (way of writing) for binary, as **three** binary bits (e.g., 111<sub>2</sub>) map directly to **one octal** digit (5<sub>8</sub>).

</div>

**Example:** The number **743<sub>8</sub>** is an Octal number and it is calculated as: 

<div class="steps">

**= (7. 8<sup>2</sup>) + (4. 8<sup>1</sup>) + (3. 8<sup>0</sup>) <br>= 448 + 32 + 3 <br>= 483<sub>10</sub>**

</div>

The table below shows the relationship between **octal** and **binary** numbers (as mentioned earlier each octal digit represents **3** bits in binary):

|**Octal Number**|**Binary Equivalent**|
|:----|:---- |
|**0**| **000** |
|**1**|**001**|
|**2**|**010**|
|**3**|**011**|
|**4**|**100**|
|**5**|**101**|
|**6**|**110**|
|**7**|**111**|
