An electric circuit (also known as electric network) is an interconnection of electrical elements linked together in a closed path so that an electric current may flow continuously.

An electric current (or electrical current) can be defined as the flow of electric charge, which is the movement of charged particles like electrons, and is a key property of an electric circuit.

Let's imagine water flowing through a pipe in our homes. The "pipe" is the electric circuit, or the conductor, and the "current" is the rate at which the water flows through the pipe (e.g, liters per minute).

There are 2 types of current:

* DC (Direct Current): This is when the current flowing through an element is constant and unidirectional (meaning it does not change direction). Most modern electronic devices, such as smartphones and computers, use DC internally. Batteries can produce and store DC power to be used by other devices; for example, electric vehicle batteries. 
Solar panels generate DC electricity


* AC (Alternating Current): This is when current flowing through an element is not constant, and the flow can change direction periodically, meaning the voltage also varies, and this creates a wave-like pattern. AC can easily have its voltage increased or decreased; this is an example of how electricity is transmitted from power plants to our homes, or the electricity from our homes' wall sockets that we use to power everyday devices like refrigerators, televisions, washing machines, etc.
