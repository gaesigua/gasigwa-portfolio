# Hardware and Software

The two primary parts of any computer system are its hardware and software.

## Hardware
Hardware refers to the physical parts of the computer that you can touch. This includes:
*   **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The "brain" of the computer.
*   **Memory (RAM):** Temporary storage for data and programs.
*   **Storage (Hard Drive/SSD):** Long-term storage for your files.

## Software
Software is the set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. This includes:
*   The Operating System (like Windows, macOS, or Linux).
*   Applications (like your web browser or a text editor).
